A widely used tool for language analysis is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). This tool includes dictionaries that categorize words into various classes such as pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, articles, and words conveying positive and negative emotions, or relating to friends and family.

To detect AI-generated texts, TuringBench utilizes a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models. Specifically, they employ models like RoBERTa, BERT, and other neural network architectures such as N-gram based models, SVMs, and specialized AI detectors like the OpenAI detector. These models are trained and evaluated on tasks such as Authorship Attribution and Turing Test scenarios.

Our primary contribution is a statistical framework for human detection that can be used to quantify the detectability of a machine for a given human detection context that is agnostic to content modality and generation task. The framework provides the language required to analyze important aspects of the human detection problem such as the progression of a family of models towards human-like abilities and the effectiveness of different classifiers for human detection. Secondary to the proposed framework is the contribution of a human detection method, ProxiHuman, that utilizes the geometry of a machine’s embedding space to determine the origin (human or machine) of content.

The primary goal of the XAI framework is to identify which types of explanations and models provide the highest levels of transparency and trustworthiness from the user's perspective. By standardizing the evaluation of model interpretability, the framework aims to guide the development of more transparent and user-friendly AI systems.
